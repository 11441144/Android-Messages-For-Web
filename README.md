# Android Messages For Web
Unofficial Chrome app created to make it easier for ChromeOS users to access android messages.  This will open the https://messages.android.com page within a ChromeOS app window, instead of opening messages in a chrome tab.  This shows a handy icon in the app drawer and also supports multi-tasking with an app window that can be resized to fit your workspace requirements!

Changelog:
 -:v1.3:- Initial release
 -:v1.5:- Added a dark titlebar theme and theme toggle button next to window controls.  Make your app window styling match the theme used by Android Messages for Web!

You can use your computer to chat with your friends through Messages for web, which shows what’s on your Android Messages mobile app. Android Messages for web sends SMS messages using a connection from your computer to your phone, so carrier fees will apply, just like on the mobile app.

Note: The QR code for Messages for web is unique to your computer and pairs the mobile app to that computer. You can pair your Messages account on multiple devices, but only one will be active at a time. When you open Messages for web on a computer, your conversations on any other computers or browser tabs will become inactive.
